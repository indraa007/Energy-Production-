In this project the dataset provided to me. And firstly i used EDA process to chekc null values, duplicates and done with data visualization part also. 
After completion of EDA process we started with the model building part in which we used supervised machine learning algorithms to check the performance.
After done with model building with 5 6 regression algorithms done with model evaluation part, in which we can identify which model is giving best accuracy for the data.
ANd at last we done with the model deployment using streamlit based on the model which gave best accuracy. As a result it will create the web page to show the result.
